So this is going to be a documentation journey of me learning and writing every information i can find about how react internals work; If this blogs gets published, this will get live updated so keep that in mind;

I am currently in the journey to build an application that will allow you to monitor any react re-render; Now their are some very cool solution already to this I know. But their are few things better than writing you own!

## react-reconcile
if you have every used the vite-react-ts template, you will find a code like this
```jsx
import reactDoom from "react-dom"

reactDom.render(<Compoennt />, document.getElement("app"))
```
I am writing this freehand so something could be wrong! (*sneaky voice* if you don't mind). This `reactDom` is created using the react-reconcile package. It provides us with some function which will get invoked by the react package; You can use this package to create custom render;  web, command-line, video using ff-mpeg, or some other unknown platform.

TODO `ADD example to show how to use react-reconcile`

## OK I lie'd
I cheated and saw the source code of a lib (react-scan) that dose exactly what I am solving. But the problem is very big and their source code even bigger; its like 2000+ line of code. I did not take a deep look but from what I could understand they use __REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__ this global hook is created by react-dev-tool, and the internal react lib has preexisting support for dev-tool; It calls this object with pre-known methods name; which you can create custom implementation of! It gives you access to the **react-fiber**.

## Fiber
Like the lack of fiber in your diet why causes constipation, react also had fiber; or simply a tree node; is simple right! no WTF do you thing this is. some easy to understand topic; its complicated very complicated I mean if not why do they even keep you for? 

Due to react-fiber being a very internal data structure of react, its not very clean. you can find the definition of the fiber inside of `packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactInternalTypes.js` the fiber nodes; can be messy and what methods and property will be available will depend upon the `tag` property of the fiber. Another major property to look out for is `elementType` as this is helps to identify which unique element dose the Fiber generate!

```jsx
// packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactInternalTypes.js
// A Fiber is work on a Component that needs to be done or was done. There can
// be more than one per component.
export type Fiber = {
  // These first fields are conceptually members of an Instance. This used to
  // be split into a separate type and intersected with the other Fiber fields,
  // but until Flow fixes its intersection bugs, we've merged them into a
  // single type.

  // An Instance is shared between all versions of a component. We can easily
  // break this out into a separate object to avoid copying so much to the
  // alternate versions of the tree. We put this on a single object for now to
  // minimize the number of objects created during the initial render.

  // Tag identifying the type of fiber.
  tag: WorkTag,

  // Unique identifier of this child.
  key: null | string,

  // The value of element.type which is used to preserve the identity during
  // reconciliation of this child.
  elementType: any,

  // The resolved function/class/ associated with this fiber.
  type: any,

  // The local state associated with this fiber.
  stateNode: any,

  // Conceptual aliases
  // parent : Instance -> return The parent happens to be the same as the
  // return fiber since we've merged the fiber and instance.

  // Remaining fields belong to Fiber

  // The Fiber to return to after finishing processing this one.
  // This is effectively the parent, but there can be multiple parents (two)
  // so this is only the parent of the thing we're currently processing.
  // It is conceptually the same as the return address of a stack frame.
  return: Fiber | null,

  // Singly Linked List Tree Structure.
  child: Fiber | null,
  sibling: Fiber | null,
  index: number,

  // The ref last used to attach this node.
  // I'll avoid adding an owner field for prod and model that as functions.
  ref:
    | null
    | (((handle: mixed) => void) & {_stringRef: ?string, ...})
    | RefObject,

  refCleanup: null | (() => void),

  // Input is the data coming into process this fiber. Arguments. Props.
  pendingProps: any, // This type will be more specific once we overload the tag.
  memoizedProps: any, // The props used to create the output.

  // A queue of state updates and callbacks.
  updateQueue: mixed,

  // The state used to create the output
  memoizedState: any,

  // Dependencies (contexts, events) for this fiber, if it has any
  dependencies: Dependencies | null,

  // Bitfield that describes properties about the fiber and its subtree. E.g.
  // the ConcurrentMode flag indicates whether the subtree should be async-by-
  // default. When a fiber is created, it inherits the mode of its
  // parent. Additional flags can be set at creation time, but after that the
  // value should remain unchanged throughout the fiber's lifetime, particularly
  // before its child fibers are created.
  mode: TypeOfMode,

  // Effect
  flags: Flags,
  subtreeFlags: Flags,
  deletions: Array<Fiber> | null,

  lanes: Lanes,
  childLanes: Lanes,

  // This is a pooled version of a Fiber. Every fiber that gets updated will
  // eventually have a pair. There are cases when we can clean up pairs to save
  // memory if we need to.
  alternate: Fiber | null,

  // Time spent rendering this Fiber and its descendants for the current update.
  // This tells us how well the tree makes use of sCU for memoization.
  // It is reset to 0 each time we render and only updated when we don't bailout.
  // This field is only set when the enableProfilerTimer flag is enabled.
  actualDuration?: number,

  // If the Fiber is currently active in the "render" phase,
  // This marks the time at which the work began.
  // This field is only set when the enableProfilerTimer flag is enabled.
  actualStartTime?: number,

  // Duration of the most recent render time for this Fiber.
  // This value is not updated when we bailout for memoization purposes.
  // This field is only set when the enableProfilerTimer flag is enabled.
  selfBaseDuration?: number,

  // Sum of base times for all descendants of this Fiber.
  // This value bubbles up during the "complete" phase.
  // This field is only set when the enableProfilerTimer flag is enabled.
  treeBaseDuration?: number,

  // Conceptual aliases
  // workInProgress : Fiber ->  alternate The alternate used for reuse happens
  // to be the same as work in progress.
  // __DEV__ only

  _debugInfo?: ReactDebugInfo | null,
  _debugOwner?: ReactComponentInfo | Fiber | null,
  _debugStack?: string | Error | null,
  _debugTask?: ConsoleTask | null,
  _debugNeedsRemount?: boolean,

  // Used to verify that the order of hooks does not change between renders.
  _debugHookTypes?: Array<HookType> | null,
};
```
I am not sure but I will be also pasting the definition of tags, as it could be helpful in the future. Also I don't have to open the projects to checkout the implementation.
